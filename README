# poke327
ASCII Pok√©mon roguelike in C

Usage: ./poke327 -h | --help for switches


# Notes:
## There is an arbitrary cap on the number of trainers you can add (100). This is not because I satically allocated space for the trainers. All characters are dynamically allocated using malloc.

## Hiker, Rival, and Stationary are implemented. Hiker and Rival will stop moving when they reach the PC.


# bugs
##Other characters not implemented

##Hiker and Rival don't currently avoid other characters but instead wait for them to move.


# Stuff I did
## I implemented a simple algorithm to allow me to weight how much each character is spawned. Right now the weights are: rival=10, hiker=25, random=25 and the rest 50
## I used getopt_long to implement the commandline argument switches which made things a lot easier and allowed me to have more control over switches.
## Saving of NPCs locations between moving maps & moving the PC to the correct exit when moving maps is implemented but not shown when world_gameLoop() is called.

# setup
## use make or make all to compile

## make clean will clean the directory of compiled files
