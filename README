# poke327
ASCII Pok√©mon roguelike in C

Program currently has a fixed seed and PC location and is only calculating hiker distances for debugging purposes.

I could not get dijkstra's algorithm debugged. It currently seg faults in compare and previously did in heap_decrease_key_no_replace when assigning the parent node.

I have tried not admitting infinity nodes in the heap, allowing them, adding the costs differently, etc. Even when following the path example in the instructors code for 1.02 hasn't helped me. I couldn't find what I was missing or needed to adjust for these distance maps.
