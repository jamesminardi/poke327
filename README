# setup
## use make or make all to compile
## make clean will clean the directory of compiled files


# 1.09 Notes
## You start with 1 potion, 1 revive, 10 pokeballs, and $500 to get you started
## All requirements of 1.09 implemented including:
### Type effectiveness of moves
### NPCS drop money that you can pick up to buy more items at the pokemart
### Pokemon are not always caught immedaitely. They use the formula specified by the spec doc.
### Newly caught pokemon are sent to the pokecenter BOX when your party is full.
### You are able to swap pokemon from the box into your party, replacing whatever pokemon was in there.
### NOTE: You can't move a pokemon from your party into the box, only if you have a pokemon already in the box may you do that.
## No known bugs


# 1.08
## Notes:
### You start with 5 of each of the 3 items
### If a message has "..." at the top, it requires an acknowledgement (Press any key to continue)
### capital B for bag in overworld. Or use i
### If you have no pokemon alive, you will be followed by trainers but not battled
### If you lose to a trainer, it is marked as defeated just so they don't keep following you
### Menus can be finicky, but you just have to pay attention to whether or not you're selecting a move or acknowledging a message at the top.
### If you press capital Q during a battle, it will force exit the program. Ignore this. If you do it you have to reset your terminal, only there for debugging
## No known major bugs



# 1.07
## Notes:
### There is a 10% chance to encounter a random pokemon when moving in tall grass
### The random pokemon has a random moveset of max=2 with only moves in its level-up learnset
### This means pokemon (especially lower level pokemon) won't have any moves because we are using version 19 of the pokemon games
### When encountering a random pokemon, all of its stats are shown including level, gender, shiny, stats, and ivs.
### Pres ESC to defeat the random pokemon.

# 1.05
## Notes:
### There is an arbitrary cap on the number of trainers you can add (100). This is not because I statically allocated space for the trainers. All characters are dynamically allocated using malloc.
### Hiker and Rival will stop pathing to the PC after being defeated
### Map state is stored when changing maps.
### Returning to a previously visited map will be the same except a turn will be advanced for that action. This is a slight nerf to swapping between maps quickly
### Hiker and Rival will path to the PC's last valid location if the PC moves to a tile with Infinity cost for the trainers.

## bugs
## Scrolling trainers screen not working correctly
## Hiker and Rival don't currently avoid other characters but instead wait for them to move.

## Stuff I did
## I implemented a simple algorithm to allow me to weight how much each Character is spawned. Right now the weights are: rival=10, hiker=25, random=25 and the rest 50
## I used getopt_long to implement the commandline argument switches which made things a lot easier and allowed me to have more control over switches.
