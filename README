# Notes:
## There is an arbitrary cap on the number of trainers you can add (100). This is not because I statically allocated space for the trainers. All characters are dynamically allocated using malloc.
## Hiker and Rival will stop pathing to the PC after being defeated
## Map state is stored when changing maps.
## Returning to a previously visited map will be the same except a turn will be advanced for that action. This is a slight nerf to swapping between maps quickly
## Hiker and Rival will path to the PC's last valid location if the PC moves to a tile with Infinity cost for the trainers.


# bugs
## Scrolling trainers screen not working
## Hiker and Rival don't currently avoid other characters but instead wait for them to move.

# Stuff I did
## I implemented a simple algorithm to allow me to weight how much each character is spawned. Right now the weights are: rival=10, hiker=25, random=25 and the rest 50
## I used getopt_long to implement the commandline argument switches which made things a lot easier and allowed me to have more control over switches.

# setup
## use make or make all to compile

## make clean will clean the directory of compiled files
